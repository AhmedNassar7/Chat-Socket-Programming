# Chat-by-Socket-Programming 
Developed a chat application using socket programming in Java, incorporating object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and integrating a SQL database for message storage. The application enables real-time communication between multiple clients connected to a central server.
                                                            --------------------------------------------------
Designed and implemented the client-server architecture using socket programming in Java, allowing clients to connect to the server and exchange messages.
Developed the server component to handle incoming client connections, manage message routing, and ensure reliable message delivery.
Implemented the client component with a user-friendly interface, supporting user input and displaying received messages.
Incorporated OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create modular and maintainable code.
Integrated a SQL database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store chat messages, facilitating message persistence and retrieval.
Designed the message format, including sender, receiver, timestamp, and message content, and ensured proper serialization and deserialization.
Implemented multithreading techniques to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, ensuring efficient and responsive communication.
Implemented database operations, including storing new messages, retrieving chat history, and managing message indexes.
Incorporated database concepts like table design, SQL queries, and transaction management to ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval.
Implemented additional features such as authentication, encryption, and error handling to enhance application security and reliability.
Applied software engineering best practices, including code documentation, unit testing, and version control (e.g., Git).
